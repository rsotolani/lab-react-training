/*
Create a CreditCard component that displays a rectangle with the information coming from the props.

The component should take 8 props:

type: A string that can be "Visa" or "Master Card"
number: A string that is the number of the credit card. For security reasons, you should only display the 4 last digits ðŸ˜‰
expirationMonth: A number that represents the month, between 1 and 12
expirationYear: A number that represents the year
bank: A string that represents the name of the bank
owner: A string that represents the name of the owner
bgColor: A string for the background color of the card
color: A string for the text color of the card
Take your time to make the component look as close to the expected output as possible. You'll probably want to use flexbox.
